# WalMart-Kaggle-LSTM-NN

## Getting Started
Current implementation utilized Python 3.6.1, sklearn 0.19.0, pandas 0.20.3, tensorflow 1.10, Keras 2.0.8, Neon 1.5.4, and numpy 1.3.1.

## Running Tests
These are LSTM models trained on WalMart's "Recruiting: Store Sales Forecasting" Kaggle competition 3 years ago using Python.

The tensorflow portion is based in part by Jason Brownlee's "Multi-variate Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs in Keras".

Script as is provides basics in cleaning the data, creating some new features and utilizing multi-layer LSTMs to try and predict sales in a time-series dataset.
